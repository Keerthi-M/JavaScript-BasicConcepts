# JavaScript-basicConcepts1
Basics concepts of JavaScript such as declaration of variables,use of conditions and logical operators,functions and scope are explained well with relevant problems and its solutions
## Tasks done in this repository 

Section : 1.1 ( Introduction ) :
Description:
Renu and Reka are preparing for the Mathematics examination.
Renu has a doubt in solving one of the problems. Reka helps her to
figure out the solution for the problem. Find the discount percentage
of the Dress which has it's listing price as 550 and selling price as 230?

Instruction:

declare variables and function names.

Conditions followed:
1. Percentage symbol is must.
2. The discount percent should be in round off form.


Section : 1.2 ( Conditionals ) :
Description:
Cypher Source website has 3ways to login to the site - Using

1. Code should be properly commented and should explain the
block well.
2. Camel spacing ( naming convention ) should be used to declare variables and function names.

Hint :
1. In Tom’s case Mail and Facebook logins should be assumed as
false and Google login as true, as he logs through Google.
2. Use the conditions and logical operators to perform.


Section : 1.3 (Functions) :
Description:
Mobin has developed an Application that displays the
temperature. His Application displays the temperature in two
conditions :

➢ If greater than 23.5 °C, print its’ a hot day   
➢ If it's less than 23.5 °C, print it's a cold day.

Define a function 'Temperature' for finding the condition of the day.

Instruction:

block well.
2. Declare a variable 'Day'.
3. Call the function Temperature and assign the result of the call to
the Day.


Section : 1.4 ( Scope) :

Description:
function fun()   
{ <br>
let localLet = "This is a local variable";
console.log(globalLet);
console.log(localLet); <br>
} <br>

Instruction:
1. Declare the global variable using 'globalLet ' as a variable to
